# ReactJS Technical Assessment

[Live demo](https://peteredhead.github.io/binder)

## Installation Instructions
* Checkout this repository
* `cd binder`
* `npm install`
* `npm start`
* Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Tests
A few token tests are included. These can be run using the command `npm run test`

### Known Issues
On small mobile devices, when viewing table pages with high numbers (>1000), the width of the pagination component may exceed the width of the screen.

On the live demo, because the page is hosted within the /binder subdirectory, this is interpreted as NaN in the address bar when viewing the first table page.
